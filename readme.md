## Production Details
For books without available digital editions, a PDF version is OCRed. Where epubs are available, the text is extracted. In both case, the digitized text is  cross-referenced with the original printed editions to ensure accuracy. The text is formatted into Markdown, minimizing HTML use to maintain simplicity and readability. The Markdown documents serve as the basis for creating both the final text and epub versions. Very few corrections are made and all are still consistent with publishing norms of the 1920s. For instance, different treatments of songs fragments in the original texts (such as use of quotation marks, block quotes, italics, or combinations thereof) are standardized in these digital versions.

If you are interested in helping out, let [me](mailto:neal.caren@gmail.com) know. While [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org) is the central repository for new transcriptions of public domain books, their contributors continue to largely overlooked Black authors from this era. Their submission process is cumbersome and idiosyncratic, so after producing three books for them, I decided to start a complementary effort.
