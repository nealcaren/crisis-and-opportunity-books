This site is designed to facilitate the digitalization and dissemination of public domain works from the Harlem Renaissance. 

As of 2024, twelve major novels from the era are no longer under copyright. Digital versions of three currently exist[^g], but we are thrilled to produce new editions of four additional books:

[^g]: While [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org) is the central repository for transcriptions of public domain books, their contributors continue to largely overlooked Black authors from this era. Their submission process is cumbersome and idiosyncratic, so after producing three books for them, I decided to start a complementary effort.

## Production Details

Each book has been carefully replicated from the earliest available print edition. In cases where digital editions are unavailable, a draft text version is created from the PDF using OCR. Where EPUBs exist, the text is  extracted directly. In both cases, the digitized text is carefully cross-referenced with the printed edition to ensure fidelity.  We format the text into Markdown, prioritizing simplicity and readability while minimizing HTML usage. These Markdown documents then serve as the foundation for generating both the final text and EPUB versions. 

While we strive to reproduce the text as the author intended, these releases are new editions and not exact duplicates of the first editions. For example, design elements like drop caps at the beginning of chapters are not reproduced. Overall, formatting changes are minimal. All materials are available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/nealcaren/crisis-and-opportunity-books).
