## A New Novel from the Acclaimed Author of "Home to Harlem"

In the heart of Marseilles, a vibrant group of black beachcombers gather around their leader, the banjo-playing Banjo. As they hustle for survival, their lives intertwine with the diverse and colorful characters of the city's underworld. Experience the pulsating rhythm of the streets, the lively tunes of the bars, and the camaraderie of these men as they navigate a world of love, laughter, and hardship. With vivid imagery and poetic prose, McKay paints a captivating portrait of a marginalized community, revealing their resilience and spirit in a society that often overlooks them.
